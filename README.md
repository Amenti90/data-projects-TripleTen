Purpose: The executive team was interested in understanding how well the website is converting product page views into purchases.
Methods/Techniques: Created conversion funnel and calculated retention rates using Google Sheets.
Results: Just over 10% of visitors to the site made a purchase. The analysis shows strong initial engagement with a steep dropoff over time.

Recommendations: Develop outreach to target users with discounts after the first and second.
